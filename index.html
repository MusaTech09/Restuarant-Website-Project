				Welcome to Apricity, the restuarant that takes things back to another time. Located in the woods of Asheville, NC, our restaurant cooks a variety of different dishes. Our cooks live by only one rule: all of the food they cook must be hunted, gathered, and grown from the land of the surrounding mountains. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Join us and experience food that was resourced by our staff from the natural land we live in. Try new dishes such as rabbit soup, bison burgers, dandelion salad, and much more! Apricity will open your eyes to all new possiblities with food gathered by local hands and made with natural love.
