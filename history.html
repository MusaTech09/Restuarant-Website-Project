				 Apricity was founded in 2018 by Sebastian Taylor, who grew up in North Carolina. He was always passionate about nature and the world around him, so he enrolled in a wilderness course when he was 20 years old. There, he learned not only how to appreciate and survive in nature, but how to thrive in it. In 2020, Taylor bought land in the distant woods of Asheville, and has been homesteading since then. His love for food led him to open Apricity, where he would be able to share his dishes to everyone willing to try.

Apricity originally started with Taylor preparing meals for his friends during their weekly camping trips. After many comments from friends and friendly campfire participants, Taylor decided to build the log cabin that is now the restuarant. Togther with old and new friends, Taylor continued the same traidition of cooking and sharing creative recipes, but this time with the public.
