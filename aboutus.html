			<h2>How We Started</h2>

			<p>
				Apricity was founded in 2018 by Sebastian Taylor, who grew up in North Carolina. He was always passionate about nature and the world around him, so he enrolled in a wilderness course when he was 20 years old. There, he learned not only how to appreciate and survive in nature, but how to thrive in it. In 2020, Taylor bought land in the distant woods of Asheville, and has been homesteading since then. His love for food led him to open Apricity, where he would be able to share his dishes to everyone willing to try.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apricity's mission statement is to share the love and bounty of nature by educationing people with food. Every meal that you eat has been hunted, gathered, and grown from the very land around it. A dedicated team of hunters, gatherers, and gardners ensure that healthy and natural food remains in stock. 
			</p>

			<h2>The Process</h2>

			<p>
				Each week, the menu at Apricity changes, and dishes are avaiable until ingredients run out. Because our inventory depends on the seasons and availibity of the land, we keep our menu and hours flexible. As such, we are always closed the final week of each month. During our closing times, our staff travels to various parts of the Appachalaian mountians to replenish our inventory. 
			</p>

			<h2>WE ARE HIRING!</h2>
